# Lithium

Lithium is an experimental, library operating system designed to be a *lightweight* and *secure* execution environment for serverless functions. Leveraging the power of [unikernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel), Lithium provides a new runtime providing networking, concurrency, and I/O primitives for writing serverless Rust functions while providing necessary isolation through the hypervisor.
